# Gatsby Pages

Pre-configured Gatsby project that's ready to deploy to gh-pages because I've had to do this too many times already. 
Using this primarily for my personal website as I have different projects/portions I'd like to include in separate repos instead of one monolithic one.

## Comes with

* gh-pages
* this readme.
