# Gatsby Pages

Pre-configured Gatsby project that's ready to deploy to gh-pages because I've had to do this too many times already. 
Using this primarily for my personal website as I have different projects/portions I'd like to include in separate repos instead of one monolithic one.

## Comes with

* gh-pages
* Sass
* ESLint configured with AirBnB and Prettier configuration [credits](https://medium.com/@joshuacrass/javascript-linting-and-formatting-with-eslint-prettier-and-airbnb-30eb746db862)
* Breakpoints in `styles/breakpoints.scss`
